        In this position I use machine learning to evaluate the therapeutic effects of fiction on individuals who suffer from depression and anxiety. The goal is is train a neural network to be able to read large numbers of narratives and assess their likely impact on the populations of interest; the training will be based on clinical data from real-world readers. This interdisciplinary project is situated at the intersection of the humanities, experimental psychology and computational linguistics, and forms part of a wider move towards blending interpretive and empirical methodologies.
