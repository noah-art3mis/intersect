Tell me about yourself and I will search for jobs based on vibes. No need to use your CV. Paste the lyrics of your favourite song, the words of a poem or a description of your pet. Any text will do. (Using your CV is also fine.)

This is essentially intersecting two searches - one using a keyword and another using the meaning of a text. You can think of this as searching both for what you want and what you need.
