# Intersect - Personalized job matching

Find the job you actually want - using AI.

Finds jobs based on vibes instead of specific parameters. Uses a similarity search workflow with embedding models to compare your CV with jobs descriptions. Reorders listings based on similarity with the input text, not unlike a [recommendation](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/recommendation_using_embeddings) algorithm. This is not supposed to substitute manual search, but to make it easier by ordering the results by relevance. This can also be combined with more traditional NLP techniques such as TF-IDF.

Assignment for the Right Word module at LIS.

## Tech stack:

-   `uv`: environment and dependency management
-   `streamlit`: UI frontend
-   `openai`: embedding model
-   `pandas`: storing data
-   `scrapeops`: scraping proxy

## Explanations

-   OpenAI and Streamlit are the fastest ways to make a prototype.
-   There is no need to use the bigger embedding model for this use case.
-   For a small job like this there is no need for a vector database. There is no need to use SQL yet. Feather does the job.
-   For similarity we can use a dot product because OpenAI embeddings are normalized.

-   Respects robots.txt
-   Scraping
    -   just a request doesnt work (403)
    -   request with user agent doesnt work (403)
    -   request with genuine headers doesnt work (403)
    -   request with scrapeops fake headers doesnt work (403)
    -   request with scrapeops proxy works but takes like 20s per request. this is tolerable for this application. scrapeops is free.
-   test cvs generated by chatgpt with the prompt 'generate the perfect cv for this position' get around 0.65 similarity.
-   BM25 is an altered version of TF-IDF that is standard in the industry.

    -   https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/retrievers/bm25_retriever/
    -   bm25f can weight different parameters as relevant but at this point you are replicating the job board and that is out of scope.

## TODO

-   core functionality
    -   [ ] add scraping for all pages
    -   [ ] add scraping for descriptions
    -   [ ] add real time scraping )editing url etc)
    -   [ ] add evals (manual x embedding x llm x bm25)
    -   [ ] decide name
        -   [ ] Axis
        -   [ ] Compass
        -   [ ] Intersect
        -   [ ] Pathway
        -   [ ] Waypoint
    -   [ ] The NLP-aided analysis of a corpus of documents will extract non-obvious insights from a corpus of documents using tools from coding and data science. The corpus of documents could consist of a literary archive, a body of social media posts, a scrape from an online knowledge database; ideally, these would have some relation to the capstone problem. The submission should offer a graphical representation of its discoveries and include a write up of c. 500 words the documents the process involved. A link to an executable code notebook should also be included as part of the submission.
    -   [ ] Assessment Choice 2 should be submitted as a PDF file that contains a brief summary of the submission and which contains a link to a GitHUb repository where the code notebook and all relevant data can be found - max 500 words
-   new features
    -   [ ] prepend other cols before embedding. check difference
    -   [ ] add 'x days ago' instead of datetime
    -   [ ] add pdf uploading and ocr
    -   [ ] add support for local and open source embedding models. see [MTEB](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard). use something like `ollama`
    -   [ ] add alternatives for search such as BM25
    -   [ ] add caching
    -   [ ] add reranking
    -   [ ] add clustering viz
    -   [ ] add logging
    -   [ ] upgrade database to sqlite
    -   [ ] add other features to make selection easier (sponsoring, etc)
    -   [ ] add reverse mode (employers ordering applicants by relevance)
        -   this would be bad for interdisciplinarians as they would not be ranked very highly.
    -   [ ] try using LLMs for this and compare the result
    -   [ ] add NLP things (named entity recognition, topic modelling)
    -   [ ] add cost tracking
    -   [ ] add tracking the bluesky firehose for ai jobs
