# Intersect - Personalized job matching

Find the job you actually want - using AI.

Cyborg search -- both humanized and automated.

Tell me about yourself -- no need to use your CV. Paste the lyrics to your favourite song. X. Or do whatever. Any text will do, including your CV. Compare the results of your CV with your actual interests! This is supposed to be an edifying experience -- the journey might inform you better than the destination.

Finds jobs based on vibes instead of specific parameters. Uses a similarity search workflow with embedding models to compare your CV with jobs descriptions. Reorders listings based on similarity with the input text, not unlike a [recommendation](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/recommendation_using_embeddings) algorithm. This is not supposed to substitute manual search, but to make it easier by ordering the results by relevance. This can also be combined with more traditional NLP techniques such as TF-IDF.

## Tech stack:

-   `uv`: environment and dependency management
-   `streamlit`: UI frontend
-   `openai`: embedding model
-   `pandas`: storing data
-   `scrapeops`: scraping proxy
-   `pypdf`: pdf parsing
-   `scikit-learn`: PCA

## Explanations

-   OpenAI and Streamlit are the fastest ways to make a prototype.
-   There is no need to use the bigger embedding model for this use case.
-   the cost shouldnt be an issue unless you are embedding millions of documents.
-   For a small job like this there is no need for a vector database. There is no need to use SQL yet. Feather does the job.
-   For similarity we can use a dot product because OpenAI embeddings are normalized.

-   Respects robots.txt
-   Scraping
    -   just a request doesnt work (403)
    -   request with user agent doesnt work (403)
    -   request with genuine headers doesnt work (403)
    -   request with scrapeops fake headers doesnt work (403)
    -   request with scrapeops proxy works but takes like 20s per request. this is tolerable for this application. scrapeops is free.
-   test cvs generated by chatgpt with the prompt 'generate the perfect cv for this position' get around 0.65 similarity.
-   BM25 is an altered version of TF-IDF that is standard in the industry.

    -   https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/retrievers/bm25_retriever/
    -   bm25f can weight different parameters as relevant but at this point you are replicating the job board and that is out of scope.
    -   the pdf/text input can be anything that you like. search for a job that is like a song or a poem or something. go nuts
    -   note that the similarity values do not mean much of anything in absolute. see

        -   https://vaibhavgarg1982.medium.com/why-are-cosine-similarities-of-text-embeddings-almost-always-positive-6bd31eaee4d5
    -   much like llms, embeddings do averages. and so this is going to be generic. if you are trying to do something fancy, you might want to use this in a nonstandard way as well. such as using weird keywords in the search.
    -   biggest issue time-wise is the free proxies. just buy good ones. also less of a security risk.
    -   for a production-grade implementation of this we might want to take a look at https://github.com/AmenRa/retriv
    -   Elastic search setup is a bit more involved so out of scope
    -   why pca and kmeans

bm25 is is an industry standard algorithm for search. bm25 itself is a variation on tfidf. this uses the lucene method as it is the default of the bm25s package.

can also add a reranker after the semantic search

-   cohere rerank
-

measure how much time it takes to use a reranker and ebedding local and remote.

lexical search. sparse vectors
semantic search. dense vectors.

## TODO

-   for showcasing
    -   [ ] add clustering viz
        -   show your dot / transform space around your dot
        -   add color to your dot
        -   auto cluster n
    -   [ ] add NLP things (named entity recognition, topic modelling)
    -   [ ] add evals (original x embedding x bm25 x rerank x mteb x llm)
        -   [ ] bm25s
            -   fix ocr spacing bugs first
            -   show title and delta
        -   [ ] reranker

            - cohere supports reranking for structured data
        -   [ ] mteb local embedding

-   core functionality
    -   [ ] assemble etl
        -   [ ] get description
            -   [ ] add async to scraping
        -   [ ] get embedding
-   new features
    -   [ ] infer keywords and city from the text. do several at once
    -   [ ] add 'x days ago' instead of datetime
    -   [ ] add sponsor column by comparing to the ukvi excel spreadsheet
    -   [ ] prepend other cols before embedding
    -   [ ] upgrade database to sqlite
    -   [ ] add reverse mode (employers ordering applicants by relevance)
        -   this would be bad for interdisciplinarians as they would not be ranked very highly.
    -   [ ] add tracking the bluesky firehose for ai jobs

## Job boards

Some info on this [here](https://www.techradar.com/best/uk-job-sites) and [here](https://seemehired.com/blog/the-top-uk-job-boards-and-hiring-platforms-to-find-talent-in-2024/)

Each one of these would need a bespoke scraping strategy.
