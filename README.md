# Intersect - Personalized job matching

Find the job you actually want - using AI.

Finds jobs based on vibes instead of specific parameters. Uses a similarity search workflow with embedding models to compare your CV with jobs descriptions. Reorders listings based on similarity with the input text, not unlike a [recommendation](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/recommendation_using_embeddings) algorithm. This is not supposed to substitute manual search, but to make it easier by ordering the results by relevance. This can also be combined with more traditional NLP techniques such as TF-IDF.

Assignment for the Right Word module at LIS.

## Tech stack:

- `uv`: environment and dependency management
- `streamlit`: UI frontend
- `openai`: embedding model
- `pandas`: storing data
- `httpx` and `selectolax`: scraping

## Explanations

- OpenAI and Streamlit are the fastest ways to make a prototype.
- There is no need to use the bigger embedding model for this use case.
- For a small job like this there is no need for a vector database. There is no need to use SQL yet. Feather does the job.
- For similarity we can use a dot product because OpenAI embeddings are normalized.
- _CV-Library_ is cited by the [UK Government](https://nationalcareers.service.gov.uk/careers-advice/advertised-job-vacancies).
