    "-   [ ] The NLP-aided analysis of a corpus of documents will extract non-obvious insights from a corpus of documents using tools from coding and data science. The corpus of documents could consist of a literary archive, a body of social media posts, a scrape from an online knowledge database; ideally, these would have some relation to the capstone problem. The submission should offer a graphical representation of its discoveries and include a write up of c. 500 words the documents the process involved. A link to an executable code notebook should also be included as part of the submission.\n",
